Given the scope of the project and its intent, I have tried to pack in as much as I can with respect to validations, listing
information and token authentication. However this project definitely can be scaled by incorporating the following
enhancements:

1. Creating a web application that can communicate with the web service. This will help in translating the actual response 
times when the data is loaded on html. It will also help in storing the user tokens in the browser at client-side, thereby
giving a better insight on how token authentication works.

2. This web service can be scaled such that it can be used both, by the user and the admin. More endpoints such as 
getting the user by _id, name and other filters can be implemented to incorporate admin functions.

3. User endpoints such as file upload, file delete and user information such as address, contact details can be added to enable
accessing data based on different filters.

4. In case of sensitive information being retrieved, JWT Route authentication method can be implemented. This method essentially
validates whether the information being displayed is shown to a valid user. This feature can be useful in e-commerce web
applications.


There are many other enhancements that can be added to this project. Above are some of them that I feel are the most desirable
ones.
